## Welcome to my GitHub, guys!

My name is Gabriel Coelho, I'm 20 years old and I'm an Aerospace Engineering student at <a href="https://ufmg.br/a-universidade">UFMG</a>, where I'm part of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/czarspace/">Czar Space</a>, a research team focused on the development of CubeSats. 
At the same time, I also love working with software development (whether it's embedded, web or related to data analysis).

My goal here is to show you some small personal projects and a little of what I've learned so far.

**Stay tuned! One day you will see the code of the craziest space probe in the world here! Hahaha**

*P.S I love Python (but it's a secret, ok?).*
